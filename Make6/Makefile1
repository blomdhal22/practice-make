# $@ : the name of the file to be ``made''
# $* : the shared prefix of the target and dependent - only for suffix rules
# $< : the name of the related file that caused the action (the precursor to the target) - this is only for suffix rules
# $? : the set of dependent names that are younger than the target
# $$ : escapes macro substitution, returns a single ``$''.
